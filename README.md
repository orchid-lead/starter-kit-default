# starter-kit-default
The default starter kit used for initializing a new Orchid Lead project.

This is the default starter kit for Orchid Lead. It is what you get when you run `orchid-lead init` without specifying a starter kit. It has no dependancies beyond Orchid Lead itself.

This is a great starting point for someone who wants to try Orchid Lead. This starter kit will help newcomers understand how Orchid Lead works and what it can do.
